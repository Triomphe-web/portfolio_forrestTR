## Background

JIRAMA, is the national water and electricity company of Madagascar. Created on October 17, 1975, it results from the merger of two companies which carried out similar activities at the time: the Society Malagasy des Eaux et Electricite (SMEE) and the Societe des Energies de Madagascar (SEM).

I have worked as a System and Network Technician, specializing in the implementation of a private cloud storage server using Linux. At JI.RA.MA, the requirement was to establish a platform for managing personal files within a private cloud-based web interface hosted on their server, accessible to all JI.RA.MA employees. In this capacity, I played a pivotal role in configuring and maintaining the server infrastructure to ensure seamless accessibility and secure storage of critical data for the organization
